## Getting Started

This project was started from new flutter app

We have 4 widget classes including main.dart. In which two are stateless and two stateful.

We also have a model class for static data map with aplhabets.

Obviously the app can be improved and could have been implemented better.. but this is what I could get to in few hours as a first time flutter user."# spell_your_name"
